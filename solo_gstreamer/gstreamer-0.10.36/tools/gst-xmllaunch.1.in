gst\-xmllaunch \- build and run a GStreamer pipeline from an XML serialization
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBgst\-xmllaunch\fR \fI[OPTION...]\fR XML\-FILE [ ELEMENT.PROPERTY=VALUE ... ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
\fIgst\-xmllaunch\fP is a tool that is used to build and run a basic
\fIGStreamer\fP pipeline, loading it from an XML description. You can
produce the XML description using gst-launch(1) with the -o option or by
calling gst_xml_write_file() in your own app.

A simple commandline looks like:

 gst\-xmllaunch my\-pipeline.xml filesrc0.location=music.mp3

This sets the location property of the element named filesrc0 to the value
"music.mp3". See gst\-launch(1) for syntax on setting element names, and
gst\-inspect to see what properties various elements have.

You can pass "-" as the XML\-FILE to read from stdin.

XML\-FILE can be a URI as well, thanks to the wizardry of libxml. I'm not really
sure what all is supported, it seems http works just fine though.

.SH "WARNING"
\fIgst\-xmllaunch\fP is deprecated and broken for all but the most simple
pipelines. It will most likely be removed in future. Don't use it.

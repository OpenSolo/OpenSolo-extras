Intro to GStreamer

GStreamer is a media-streaming architecture that I've been developing at
home for about 4 months now. It's designed to overcome some of the
problems I've seen in both the OGI Pipeline and in reading through
DirectShow docs.  After an overview of the existing OGI Pipeline, I'll
cover GStreamer's existing and planned architecture, and list what remains
to be done.  GStreamer is mostly frozen right now, as it is to be released
as 0.1.0 on Oct 31.  Major thaw will occur in a few weeks.

    GObject signals can be used to notify applications of events specific
    to this object. Note, however, that the application needs to be aware
    of signals and their meaning, so if you're looking for a generic way
    for application-element interaction, signals are probably not what
    you're looking for. In many cases, however, signals can be very useful.
    See the <ulink type="http"
      url="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gobject/stable/">GObject
    documentation</ulink> for all internals about signals.

  <title>XML in <application>GStreamer</application> (deprecated)</title>
  <para> 
    <application>GStreamer</application> used to provide functions to
    save pipeline definitions into XML format and later restore them
    again from XML.
  </para>

  <para>
    This never really worked properly for all but the most simple use cases
    though, and is also pretty much impossible to make work correctly in a
    useful way due to the dynamic nature of almost all non-trivial GStreamer
    pipelines. Consequently, this API has been deprecated and will be
    removed at some point. Don't use it.
